Why is a tree appropriate for the doctor structure?
It typically first in order so that this structure keeps the order of the intake. As people come in you need to
not loss the order of people being seen.
When might a software engineer use preorder, inorder, or postorder traversals?
I believe they would use it when organizing web requesting or processing. You might want a speicific order of actions
to go off in a speicific order. For instance if you want to push code through the CI/CD pipeline you make want to do 
a series of checks before code can migrate to a higher level. 
How do heaps help simulate real-time systems like emergency intake?
Heaps can be used in real-time systems like emergency intake to implement priority queues, allowing the system to efficiently 
manage and process tasks based on their urgency. This ensures that higher priority cases are handled first, improving 
response times and overall effectiveness in critical situations when managing a large amount of request.
